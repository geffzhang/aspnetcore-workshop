# Choosing a domain

This part of the workshop will be without coding. You need to choose the domain (requirement, functionality) for the application that will be created during the workshop. The domain should be as simple as possible, since the end goal of the workshop is to get familiar with ASP.NET Core and not to build complex application.

## Domain examples

1. Time tracker
    - As a user, I want to create new time tracking entry by entering date, client, project, hours and description
    - As a user I want to view a list of time tracking entries per month, with a summary of hours and earnings
    - As a user I want to manage, add and delete clients and projects
    - As a user I want to define future hour rate
2. Small CMS
    - As an admin, I want to create new pages with title and simple content
    - As an admin, I want to see a list of pages and manage them (edit, delete)
    - As an admin, I want to create new blog posts with title and content
    - As an admin, I want to see a list of blog posts and manage them (edit, delete)
    - As a user, I want to see the home page when I navigate to root
    - As a user, I want to see the navigation menu on all pages
    - As a user, I want to see the blog with posts sorted in descending order by date
3. Custom
    - Attendees choose the domain and create few simple user stories

## Demo code domain

This repository contains the demo code for the entire workshop. Time tracker as described above is the chosen domain. For live workshops it is preferred to use this domain, since attendees will be able to follow the workshop even if they skip some days.
